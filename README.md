Knights Travails

This script creates a chess-board-like graph object that stores all of the possible moves a knight can make from each space. It then takes two arguments to its' #knight_moves method (the knight's current position and where it wants to move to). Finally, it returns the smallest number of moves and the coordinates for each move to reach the destination.
